# Exploratory Data Analysis on Cleaned Sales Data from Data Warehouse Project

This project presents a focused **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using SQL on the cleaned datasets from the [Data Warehouse Project](https://github.com/sanjanamarri2521/SQL_DataWarehouse_Project). The primary goal is to extract early business insights and understand data distribution, customer patterns, and product performance.

---

## Datasets

All cleaned datasets used in this EDA are available in the [`datasets/`](https://github.com/sanjanamarri2521/SQL_ExploratoryDataAnalysis_Project/tree/main/datasets) folder of the original data warehouse repository.

---

## Objectives

This analysis explores multiple dimensions of the dataset to answer relevant business questions using SQL queries.

---

##  Areas of Exploration

### 1. Database Exploration
- View all tables and objects in the database
- Explore all columns and metadata in each table

### 2. Dimensions Exploration
- List all countries where customers are located
- Identify all product categories (major divisions)

### 3. Date Exploration
- Determine the first and last recorded order dates
- Calculate the number of sales years and months available
- Find the youngest and oldest customers based on birthdate

### 4. Measures Exploration
- Total number of items sold
- Average selling price
- Total number of orders placed
- Count of unique products
- Count of unique customers
- Number of customers who placed at least one order

### 5. Magnitude Exploration
- Number of customers by country
- Number of customers by gender
- Number of products by category
- Average product cost per category
- Total revenue generated by each category
- Revenue generated by each customer
- Distribution of sold items across countries

### 6. Ranking Exploration
- Top 5 products generating the highest revenue
- 5 lowest-performing products in terms of sales
- Top 10 customers by revenue
- 3 customers with the fewest orders

### 7. Change Over Time Analysis
- Sales trends analyzed by **year**, **month**, and **custom formats** to uncover seasonality and performance shifts
- Identified annual and monthly performance highs and lows
- Key SQL functions used:
  - `YEAR()`, `MONTH()` – Extract date parts for grouping
  - `DATETRUNC()` – Monthly truncation for timeline grouping
  - `FORMAT()` – Display `yyyy-MMM` format for reporting
  - Aggregations: `SUM()`, `COUNT(DISTINCT)`

**Sample Insights**:
-  *2013* had the highest total sales, customers, and items sold
-  *December* consistently showed peak performance, suggesting seasonal effects (e.g., holidays)

### 8. Cumulative Analysis
- Analyzed **running totals** and **moving averages** to observe sales progression and pricing trends over time
- Cumulative sales calculated per month within each year
- Moving average of prices computed to identify long-term pricing trends

**Key SQL functions used**:
- `SUM(...) OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)` – Running total of sales
- `AVG(...) OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)` – Moving average of price
- `DATETRUNC()` – For monthly aggregation

**Sample Insights**:
-  Sales dropped significantly in the final year (*2014*) compared to earlier years
-  Average price steadily declined after *2012*, indicating possible discounting or market shift

### 9. Performance Analysis
- Compared yearly sales of each product against their historical average and previous year’s sales
- Helps identify products that are improving, declining, or staying consistent in performance

**Key SQL functions used**:
- `AVG(...) OVER (PARTITION BY ...)` – To compute product's average yearly sales
- `LAG(...) OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)` – To compare with previous year’s sales
- `CASE WHEN` – For classifying changes (e.g., Increase, Decrease, Above/Below Average)

**Sample Insights**:
- Some products showed consistent **year-over-year growth**
- Others dropped **below their average** or declined compared to previous years

### 10. Part-to-Whole Analysis
- Evaluated the contribution of each product category to overall sales
- Helps in identifying dominant product lines and revenue concentration

**Key SQL functions used**:
- `SUM(...) OVER ()` – Total across entire result set
- `ROUND(...)`, `CAST(...)` – For percentage calculation
- `CONCAT(...)` – To format percentage values

**Sample Insight**:
-  The **Bikes** category accounted for **96%** of total sales, indicating a highly skewed product portfolio

### 11. Data Segmentation
- Categorized products into cost-based segments and grouped customers by spending and longevity

**Key SQL functions used**:
- `CASE WHEN` – For defining segmentation logic
- `DATEDIFF(...)` – To calculate customer lifespan
- `GROUP BY`, `COUNT(...)` – For frequency distribution of segments

**Sample Insights**:
-  Most products fall in the **“Below 100”** cost segment
-  Majority of customers are **“New”**, indicating limited long-term customer retention

### 12. Reporting

- Developed two consolidated reports: one for customers and one for products
- Created using SQL views for scalable, reusable reporting logic

####  Customer Report
- Aggregates customer behavior and demographics
- Includes:
  - Total orders, quantity, sales, lifespan
  - Customer segments (VIP, Regular, New)
  - Age grouping, recency, average order value (AOV), and average monthly spend

####  Product Report
- Summarizes product performance and engagement
- Includes:
  - Total customers, orders, quantity sold, sales, lifespan
  - Product segments (High Performer, Mid Range, Low Performer)
  - Recency, average order revenue (AOR), and average monthly revenue

**Key SQL Techniques**:
- `CASE WHEN` for segmentation logic
- `DATEDIFF(...)`, `AVG(...)`, `SUM(...)` for KPIs
- SQL Views (`CREATE VIEW`) for modularized reporting
