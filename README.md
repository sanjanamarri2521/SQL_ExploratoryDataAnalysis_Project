# Exploratory Data Analysis on Cleaned Sales Data from Data Warehouse Project

This project presents a focused **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using SQL on the cleaned datasets from the [Data Warehouse Project](https://github.com/sanjanamarri2521/SQL_DataWarehouse_Project). The primary goal is to extract early business insights and understand data distribution, customer patterns, and product performance.

---

## Datasets

All cleaned datasets used in this EDA are available in the [`datasets/`](https://github.com/sanjanamarri2521/SQL_ExploratoryDataAnalysis_Project/tree/main/datasets) folder of the original data warehouse repository.

---

## Objectives

This analysis explores multiple dimensions of the dataset to answer relevant business questions using SQL queries.

- List all countries where customers are located
- Identify all product categories (major divisions)

### 3. Date Exploration
- Determine the first and last recorded order dates
- Calculate the number of sales years and months available
- Find the youngest and oldest customers based on birthdate

### 4. Measures Exploration
- Total number of items sold

- Total number of orders placed
- Count of unique products
- Count of unique customers
- Number of customers who placed at least one order

### 5. Magnitude Exploration

- Number of products by category
- Average product cost per category
- Total revenue generated by each category
- Revenue generated by each customer
- Distribution of sold items across countries

### 6. Ranking Exploration
- Top 5 products generating the highest revenue
- 5 lowest-performing products in terms of sales
- Top 10 customers by revenue
- 3 customers with the fewest orders
